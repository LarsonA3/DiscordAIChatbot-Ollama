# DiscordAIChatbot-Ollama
A personal project for a discord server that involves the bot reacting to being pinged and subsequently responding to it using a pre-defined personality prompt given to the AI, while storing a definite number of messages in an array acting as short-term memory. Using this program requires an AI-capable system as well as ollama + model.
